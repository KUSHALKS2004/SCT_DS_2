Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Objective:-The goal of this project is to perform *data cleaning* and *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. We aim to understand the relationships between different features in the dataset and uncover any patterns or trends that might provide insights into the data.
Features:- *Data Cleaning*: In this step, we’ll clean up the dataset by addressing missing values, handling categorical variables, and normalizing the data as needed.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: We will explore the dataset through visualizations and descriptive statistics to gain a better understanding of the data and its structure.
- *Insight Discovery*: The goal is to find meaningful trends, such as survival rates across different genders, ages, and passenger classes, and explore how these features are related.
Tools:- *Python*: The primary programming language used to perform data analysis.
- *Pandas*: A powerful library used to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: Libraries used for creating visualizations to help us understand trends in the data.
- *Jupyter Notebook/Colab*: Interactive tools used to run Python code and document the analysis.
- *Kaggle Titanic Dataset*: The dataset being analyzed, which contains information about Titanic passengers and whether they survived or not.
Conclusion:
At the end of this project, we will have explored the Titanic dataset and cleaned it to prepare it for further analysis. We’ll have gained valuable insights into how different factors like gender, age, and class influence survival rates. This analysis can serve as a foundation for more advanced work, such as building predictive models for Titanic survival.
