# SCT_DS_2
The task involved analyzing customer data to uncover insights about customer behavior and spending patterns through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The main goal of this task was to explore the dataset and identify key patterns related to age, gender, income, and spending habits. By visualizing and understanding these trends, we can help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions.
Tools & Technologies
Python
Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains basic customer information:
`CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
`Gender`: Male or Female
`Age`: Age of the customer
`Annual Income (k$)`: Customer's yearly income
`Spending Score`: A score from 1â€“100 assigned based on spending behavior
What We Did
Visualized gender distribution to understand the customer base
Explored age and income patterns using histograms and boxplots
Analyzed how spending scores vary with age and income
Used a heatmap to identify relationships between variables
Conclusion
The analysis helped uncover meaningful insights about customer segments and their spending behavior. These findings can support better targeting in marketing strategies and improved customer understanding.
This task was a great exercise in working with real-world-like data and applying EDA techniques effectively.
